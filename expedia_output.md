### 4/10 Poor

4 out of 10 Poor

The check in check out was fine. No room service despite several calls & in person communication. They were least bothered. Did not find the in-house restaurant food any great with slack service. They need really to work around. The tap water was too saline.. Not at all a VFM Hotel.
